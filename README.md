### Retain and engage mobile users

## Installation

BoardActive for iOS supports iOS 10+. 

Building with Xcode 9 is required, which adds support for iPhone X and iOS 11.

## SDK

Currently, the SDK is available via CocoaPods or via downloading the repository and manual linking.

### CocoaPods

Add the BoardActive pod into your Podfile and run `pod install`.
```ruby
    target :YourTargetName do
      pod 'BoardActive'
    end
```

## Update Info.plist

When installing BoardActive, you'll need to make sure that you have the following entries in your `Info.plist`: `Privacy - Location Always and When In Use Usage Description`, `Privacy - Location Always Usage Description`, and `Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description`. Additionally, you'll have to add three items to `Required background modes`: `App downloads content in response to push notifications`, `App downloads content from the network`, and `App registers for location updates`. The same can be accomplished by selecting the project's primary target, selecting the `Capabilities` settings, and, under `Background Modes`, ensuring `Location updates`, `Background fetch`, and `Remote notifications` are all checked.

## Example app

There is an example app provided [here](https://github.com/BoardActive/BAKit-ios/tree/master/Example) for Swift.
