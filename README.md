### Retain and engage mobile users
Connect with customers using BoardActive's proprietary location-based marketing technology.

## Installation

BoardActive for iOS supports iOS 10 and iOS 11. 

Building with Xcode 9 is required, which adds support for iPhone X and iOS 11.

### CocoaPods
Add the BoardActive pod into your Podfile and run `pod install`.
```ruby
    target :YourTargetName do
      pod 'BoardActive'
    end
```

## Update Info.plist

When installing BoardActive, you'll need to make sure that you have the following entries in your `Info.plist`: `Privacy - Location Always and When In Use Usage Description`, `Privacy - Location Always Usage Description`, and `Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description`. Additionally, you'll have to add three items to `Required background modes`: `App downloads content in response to push notifications`, `App downloads content from the network`, and `App registers for location updates`.

This is required by Apple for all apps that send notifications and track location in the background. It is necessary when installing BoardActive due to the location-based notification functionality. Users will be prompted for location permissions ONLY when BoardActive's `boot` function is executed.


## Example app
